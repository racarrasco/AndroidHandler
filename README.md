# AndroidThermocycler
This Android app is able to command an arduino (code included) to thermocycle. The user Interface is pretty straightforward. 
The user would start up the app, then connect the arduino via usb and then will be prompted if they would allow the app to enable USB
hosting.Once it is allowed, the user would specify the type of parameters they would like to set for the thermocycling. There are 
default parameters which have only a heating and a cooling stage. Once the user goes back to the main activity, they will be able to start
thermocycling with real-time graphing.
